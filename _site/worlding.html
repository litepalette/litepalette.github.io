        <p><sup><em>I decided to write on this topic as I was intrigued with the significance of flow in our current moment, but struggled articulate it. In the process of writing, did I then find the expression for it: the simple act of noticing flow, of shifting to a relational paradigm of looking (try it!), where transmissions of power, infectious agents, affects ebb and swell, upon different mediums, the sediments left forgotten, can we hope to muster a more differentiated and kinder response-ability to help other humans and nonhumans alike. “It matters what ideas we use to think other ideas with.” Using flow to think, what kind of world can we become?</em> </sup></p>

<hr />

<p>The current pandemic draws our attention to the ontology of flow and interconnectedness. It is continua all the way down, up, beyond and back around; the transmission of the virus, messages, affects, behaviors, circulates in strange feedback loops.</p>

<p>Jussi Parikka and Tony Simpson <a href="https://www.boundary2.org/2020/04/tony-d-sampson-and-jussi-parikka-the-new-logics-of-viral-media/">note</a> the workings of a viral logics that criss-crosses from biological to cultural, technological and economic contexts. Contagion of all kinds leak out of bodies, social media, reactive emergency policies — its emergence swells across micro and macro scales. Social contagion dimensions make this a distinctly information-age pandemic, as psychological fear, anxiety, mistrust or performances of resilience ride on the circulation of behaviors and affects across various mediums, e.g. online media, public health communications. Furthermore, as the virus dominates glo-cal discourses, the dangers of converging to a <a href="https://complexity.simplecast.com/episodes/27/transcript">memetic monoculture</a> looms. One question, then, is whose narrative will preside over?</p>

<p>Author Sophie Lewis talked of our “<a href="https://thenewinquiry.com/amniotechnics/">wateriness</a>”. In this context, precarity lies in porousness that allows for contagious flows. Risk of contagion abounds not only in contiguous bodies and breath, but also within containers that societies use to conceptualise others. For some, those in crowded worker dormitories, the workplace with no sick leave, essential services workers, porousness cannot be escaped. And yet, porousness is only revealed insomuch as power allows for its visibility, and in extension, the shaping of its associated risk and policies to mitigate them. What does it take for us to trace the ebbs and swells of flows, and leave no container unturned? How can we put in place ethico-political mechanisms so that State bodies, grassroot efforts and individuals are aligned and work in cohesion?</p>

<p>COVID-19 being a zoonotic disease also makes a strong case for humans’ interconnectedness to a multispecies world. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis">Zoonoses</a> are infectious diseases that jump from non-human animals to humans, its vice versa being called reverse zoonosis. The virus infecting over 1 million humans (and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/animals.html">nonhumans</a>) worldwide ignites the <em>string figures</em> entangling humans and nonhuman critters alike. String figures, commonly known as the object of “cat’s cradle”, is a game where a string is weaved around the fingers of different people — or animals, fungi, bacteria, conceptually — constantly overlapping and intersecting with itself. Donna Haraway famously co-opted this term to conjure a symbol of the relations between worlds within earth, highlighting the necessity to produce new connections and alliances for a multispecies flourishing.</p>

<p>I see the virus being transmitted along the path of a multispecies string figures as it infects multiple host species. Bat (or pangolin) to human, human to human, human to cat, to tiger, to dog. (Working in parallel, the transmission of affects follow similar routes, flowing along the distributaries of media multiplexity.) In epidemiological terms, the COVID-19 operates on <em>density-dependent transmission</em>, meaning that the higher the density of people, the higher the chances of transmission.</p>

<p>So while we know of COVID-19 transmissibility in space, what of its temporal elements?</p>

<p>I take cues from Haraway’s book <em>Staying with the Trouble</em>, which tells of a world, our world, being a polytemporal one. With this, I turn to the field of complexity science, to a <a href="https://sfi-edu.s3.amazonaws.com/sfi-edu/production/uploads/ckeditor/2020/04/06/t-005-dobson-full-text.pdf">paper</a> by Andrew Kobman.</p>

<h2 id="fuzzy-timescales">fuzzy timescales</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>… “Complex time” [is] how temporal phenomena play out across the scales of the complexity of the earth. And what evolution has done is it’s created this interesting coupling of all of these clocks. You can think of every species as being a little clock that ticks away at its own rate and we interact at some level, but we’re not strongly coupled.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>— David Krakauer, <a href="https://complexity.simplecast.com/episodes/27/transcript">Complexity podcast, Transmission Series, Episode 2</a></p>

<p>As with every pathogen, the host species interacting with the pathogen will exhibit their own <em>epidemic cycles</em>. The species with smaller body size will have higher birth and death rates and population density, while the larger species will have the opposite. This falls under <strong><em>within-species transmissions</em></strong>, where the epidemic cycles of COVID-19 within the bat population runs on a different temporal scale than the human population — large and frequent outbreaks in hosts with low body mass, and slow, less dramatic cycles in larger hosts.</p>

<p>However, Kobman warns that if different host species increase their couplings across space, then the epidemic in a smaller organism can drive disease dynamics in a larger organism. With the increase of <strong><em>between-species transmission</em></strong> to levels where it matches <strong><em>within-species transmissions</em></strong>, strange synchronisations of time will appear — in this case, the synchronisation is dominated by the fastest clock. Humans will be running on the epidemic cycle of a bat population. This would mean a lethal synchronisation, as smaller species are abundant and recover quickly from outbreaks, while larger species cannot recover from frequent epidemics.</p>

<p>In a hypercapitalist world of exploitation and extraction of nature, increasing couplings across species provided the perfect conditions for COVID-19 to emerge.  Capital works through nature, transforming and introducing it as commodities with a system of human exchange. This produces newer sets of relationships and higher frequencies of multispecies co-mingling. Speculatively, animals captured for the food trade often become stressed, and leads to them releasing higher numbers of infective stages that can contaminate humans in the trade.</p>

<p>Of course, within-species transmissions far exceeds between-species transmissions. This exercise suggests that understanding rates of between-species transmission is an additional, vital component of disease dynamics.</p>

<p>This exercise brights to light the strange spacetime couplings</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>More importantly, bodily ethical and political obligations are also infectious. In a time of flow,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>intensely inhabiting specific bodies and places as the means to cultivate the capcity to respond to wordly urgencies with each other is the core theme</em></p>

  <p>companion species are relentlessly becoming-with</p>

  <p>natures, cultures, subjects, and objects do not preexist their intertwined wordlings   // species of all kinds are consequent upon wordly subject- and object-shaping entanglements</p>

  <p>i - we - have to relearn how to conjugate worlds with partial connections and not universals and particulars</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is during these times where we look to one another as companion species</p>

<p>Advocating for cybernetics.</p>

<p>The cybernetics of a world only recently aware of its hyper-contagious nature is now cognisant of its pre-existing multi-spatial/temporalities. How can we rethink flow as the state of being, adopt an ethics with what Donna Haraway speaks of as living-with and dying-with other beings? How has the pandemic edged us into relooking contiguity as it relates to physical and virtual proximity?</p>

<p>I have since interspersed this piece with different metaphors. That of rivers, of string figures, metaphors that abstract the substratum existence of flow.</p>

<p>//end of with something about ontology of flow again.</p>
