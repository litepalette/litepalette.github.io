                this blog makes up a palette of looseleaf writing snippets - little blocks of writings on topics i find illumining. sometimes ordered, mostly not. weaving together convergences across humanities, critical theory and computer science.

        <p><em><sup>(i have written a little about it <a href="https://litepalette.github.io/on-hmc">here</a> and am still actively trying to formulate my thoughts around it)</sup></em></p>

<p>with advances in philosophy, computer engineering and intelligent automation, we should be taking a renewed look at our digital milieu and our relationship within it. so embedded we are in it, that i believe it warrants a stronger recognition of the 21st century condition as what it always has been time perennial: multiple <em>ecologies</em> of humans and technologies.</p>

<p>we are unable to comprehend this worldview without the knee-jerk Ludditean reflex of estranging ourselves ontologically from the very tools we exist-with, understandably symptomatic of the culture-technics divide, i.e. <em>technology is separate from us, it is bad for us</em> – i attribute this to the lag in updating our normative beliefs about being and perception.</p>

<p>briefly indulging in counter-intuitions, what happens if we just embrace a process view of the world?</p>

<p>the boundaries between the ontological status of humans and technology dissolves, as we pay more attention to the liquid natures of socio-technical systems; its flow being the fulcrum in which we orient our lives and perspective around.</p>

<hr />

<p>a networked, process philosophy is nothing new. there are existing schools of philosophical thought that study this, such as the classic Latourian actor-network theory. to give this metaphysical statement more weight, i do feel we need an attempt at a transdisciplinary convergence of cybernetics, complexity science and cultural theory.</p>

<p>slightly over a decade ago, cham &amp; johnson (2007) pointed out the gaps between poststructuralism, complexity science and sociotechnical systems:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The science of cultural systems as part of complex systems theory is the postmodern science for the digital age.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>a nod to the <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-62051-0_7">reading</a> that inspired this piece, it states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… the need to move from a model-driven, component-oriented and intrinsically static view of systems to a more organic one, where the <em>complex entanglement between the social and the technical, as well as between the human and the artificial […] leads to considering community morphogenesis…</em></p>
