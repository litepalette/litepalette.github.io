                this blog makes up a palette of looseleaf writing snippets - little blocks of writings on topics i find illumining. sometimes ordered, mostly not. weaving together convergences across humanities, critical theory and computer science.

      <p><sup>Computation via information processing and information communication/transmission inheres across nature and artificial systems. Communication networks exist among eusocial organisms, like ant colonies. Somehow, somewhat, technological developments necessarily adopt after such architectures for the sustainment of human’s social organisation (e.g. the purposes of social media). What happens when they read their digital environments as an extension of, or a form of reticulation, from ancient computers? (I have yet to read in-depth analyses on neuromorphic computing and its implication on the philosophy of science, or something.)</sup> <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

As Benjamin Bratton writes for <em>The Terraforming</em>, the image of the black hole released to the public in 2019 likely gave us a renewed meaning of ourselves. While the <em>The Blue Marble</em> photograph enhanced our solidarity as “one global village” and even intensified Anthropocentricism, what kinds of identity would the image of an inevitable void create?</sup> <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
