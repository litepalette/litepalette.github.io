<h3 id="entropic-brain-principle"><strong>Entropic brain principle</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Taking psychedelics will put your consciousness into a more ‚Äòrelaxed state‚Äô</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Harris calls it going into ‚Äúvery plastic brain states‚Äù -&gt; implies its artificiality relating to the norm-brain state</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The boundedness of     imagination expands (more possibilities)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>‚Äúwe project things    onto the metaphysical space‚Äù</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In an <strong>information-theoretic view</strong>, this means higher     entropy, more uncertainty and unpredictability</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>Stream of consciousness</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Typically when one suffers     from neuroses (e.g. depression, psychosis, anxiety, existential dread), it     reflects perhaps something akin to cognitive rigidity</li>
</ul>

<p>What does this entropic state tells us about reflexivity, the ‚Äòego‚Äô self?</p>

<h3 id="the-behavioral-danger-of-psychedelics"><strong>The behavioral danger of psychedelics</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>I think this links to a     reading or a title I have come across =. Society of control</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="access-to-archetypes-when-access-to-collective-unconsious-is-unlocked"><strong>Access to archetypes when access to collective unconsious is ‚Äúunlocked‚Äù</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>I like how he calls them archetypes, as they <em>are</em> consistent across psychedelic experiences among humans</li>
  <li>Archetypes reinforce the notion of metaphors, stories, ‚Äúthe task of poets‚Äù in perhaps     uncovering the collective unconscious / tracing its origin / inception of     our Universe</li>
</ul>

<p>\What can the description of such archetypes tell us about its physics? Is a non-anthropocentric description possible? Or do archetypes necessarily peg onto (the observer‚Äôs) culture when activated - reminiscent of the anthropic principle from physics?</p>

<h3 id="a-hierarchical-organisation-in-the-cortex-beings-and-nature"><strong>A hierarchical organisation in the cortex, beings and nature</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The cortex has an hierarchical organisation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>Literal or abstractedly?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The association cortex is at the top of this hierarchy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>Mysterious and no modular, clear function</li>
      <li>Unlike the visual system</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Does something being fiction means it is less real than something? Who decides the ontological hierarchy? (which warrants violence and moral positions‚Ä¶ etc.) Layering ontologies being symptomatic of the hierarchical nature of the ordered universe?</p>

<h3 id="counterfactual-thinking-seems-to-be-unique-to-our-species"><strong>Counterfactual thinking seems to be unique to our species</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>The Bayesian brain</li>
  <li>Perhaps links nicely to the point that probabilities are, also, a useful fiction</li>
  <li>Includes imagination</li>
  <li>High-level functions</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="causality"><strong>Causality</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Causality can be an (epiphenomenon?) illusion, a <strong>useful fiction for the deeper theory of reality</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="information-theoretic-approach-for-consciousness-or-something"><strong>Information-theoretic approach for consciousness or something</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Low level VS high level processes <strong>Emergence</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>I feel I‚Äôve read things on this somewhere - representation and intentions being higher level      brain processes that would correlate to their (physical) neural substrates</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The claim that higher level processes emerges out of lower level physical processes have been     challenged</li>
</ul>
