  <p><em>The way in which we are moving into a new way of locating is to realise: we‚Äôre enveloped in a whole drama. I mean, this has been going on‚Äîwe‚Äôve been here for 200,000 years. This drama of the universe has been going 14 billion years.</em> <strong><em>We wake up inside a story everyday</em></strong>.</p>

<p>I have been craving for stories, getting lost in lands and narratives in an escapist stupor (recently read Le Guin‚Äôs Earthsea stories in a week); which was partly why I found the quote above incredibly soothing, that we wake up already inside an unfolding cosmic Story.</p>

<p>If we can (meta-)cognitively attune to unfurling-<em>with</em> and -<em>within</em> this cosmic Story, I wonder how we can re-orient ourselves, cultivate togetherness, care, love.</p>

<p><em>It matters what stories tell stories,</em> espoused Donna Haraway.</p>

<p>To identify the logic of stories as one‚Äôs epistemology is to expand one‚Äôs modes for knowing the world. One comes to know the world through stories, through netbags of metaphors in all its fuzzy logic. You invite imagination and poetry in the sensations of grass beneath your feet, in noticing the way the trees slow-waltz to certain rhythms of wind, in the line of ants marching up your walls. This allows for more ecological thinking, more thinking-with other critters, all of us entangled in an unfolding story, coming into full expression with one another.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The universe we live in gives birth to itself through relationships.</em>
<em>At the level of elementary particles, the neutron, by itself, disintegrates within 3 to 4 minutes. This is due to radioactive decay. On the other hand, if you bring the neutron in relationship with a proton, it will exist for a billion years. The very nature of the neutron relies upon forming a relationship with a proton for it to express itself.</em></p>

<p>Swimme talks about our true nature, so obvious but so overlooked, that we unfold-<em>with</em> others through relationships; through ecological assemblages and co-evolutions, in variants of cooperation or competition. Haraway echoes this, that <em>companion species are relentlessly becoming-with; Ontologically heterogenous partners become who and what they are in relational material-semiotic worlding. Natures, cultures, subjects, and objects do not preexist their intertwined worldings.</em></p>

<p><em>Sympoiesis</em>, or, collective-reproducing (Beth Dempster, 1998).</p>

<p>In other words, ‚Äúrelational worldings‚Äù, creating worlds through and with relations at every fractal scale.</p>

<p>On similar threads, Kauffman, theoretical biologist, origin of life researcher, extends the magic of stories, becoming-with, into the messy empiricism when science-meets-complexity. We invoke the spirit of collective autocatalytic<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> sets‚Äîcollectively reproducing, collectively arising‚Äîto read matter, culture, consciousness,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>[‚Ä¶] the realisation that we are members of a living world of untellable creativity in its becoming. Life is abundant, the <strong>universe is rife with becoming</strong>, based on physics but beyond any physics we know. [‚Ä¶] Creatures, by existing, <strong>create the very conditions for other creatures to come into existing</strong>. [‚Ä¶] The blossoming biosphere creates its own ever-new possibilities of becoming, yet more diverse and abundant.</em></p>

  <p><em>This ultimate, an unknowable unfolding, slips its foundational moorings and floats free.</em></p>

  <p><em>We do not live alone, we make our living world together‚Ä¶ We all are joined together in the evolving, emerging, unfolding of the biosphere as a whole.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hyphenated words opens up the semiotic space; how else can we articulate a language of collective-becoming, of sympoiesis? <em>If categories are unstable, we must watch them emerge within encounters</em>, <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691178325/the-mushroom-at-the-end-of-the-world">Anna Tsing</a> insists.</p>

<hr />
<p>Finally, a homage to the episode on Midnight Gospel that inspired this post, and lit up the synapses between the different authors I‚Äôm reading,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>So the Buddha looks at Indra‚Äôs Net and it‚Äôs basically the same topography, but he says, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not the nodes. It‚Äôs the connections.</em></p>

<p><sup> P.S. Recently, during meditation, my mind sometimes fall into some ad infinitum non-space (as vast as our consciousness can be), and I realised how art, or beauty, or the dewdrop of a moment (sensory alignment, before it plops! and ends), seems like an interface into the larger consciousness. I wondered why in certain environments, I enter such states of mind more easily (e.g. when there is wind, sitting under open sky on my porch, humidity not too heavy, etc.) than other times, which led me to the (admittedly meek) insight that perhaps symmetry (broadly), experienced subjectively, acts as interface or gateway into something cosmic.</sup></p>

<p><sup>I realise also realised that wonder is important to me. to cultivate wonder is to cultivate joy &amp; love. :)¬† also, wondering why theory engages minimally with spirituality. </sup></p>
