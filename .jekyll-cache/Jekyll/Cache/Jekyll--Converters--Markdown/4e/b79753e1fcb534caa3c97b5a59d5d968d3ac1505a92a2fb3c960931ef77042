I"¡<p>today, i write about the discourse around ‚Äúmateriality‚Äù of AI - it unwittingly interlocking with its counterpart in the philosphical tradition.</p>

<p>Some obvious questions are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How do we constitute harm - does harm only need to be material to be legitimate?</li>
  <li>What about trauma in its abstraction, its rhizomatic form?</li>
</ul>

<p>I will unravel how interesting this intersection is - the discourse</p>
