      <p><sup>Computation via information processing and information communication/transmission inheres across nature and artificial systems. Communication networks exist among eusocial organisms, like ant colonies. Somehow, somewhat, technological developments necessarily adopt after such architectures for the sustainment of human’s social organisation (e.g. the purposes of social media). What happens when they read their digital environments as an extension of, or a form of reticulation, from ancient computers?
