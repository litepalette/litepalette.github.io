<blockquote>
  <p>The way in which we are moving into a new way of locating is to realise: we’re enveloped in a whole drama. I mean, this has been going on—we’ve been here for 200,000 years. This drama of the universe has been going 14 billion years. <strong><em>We wake up inside a story everyday</em></strong>.</p>

<p>I have been craving for stories, getting lost in lands and narratives in an escapist stupor (recently read Le Guin’s Earthsea stories in a week); which was partly why I found the quote above incredibly soothing, that we wake up already inside an unfolding cosmic Story.</p>

<p>If we shift our mindsets, realise how our lives are unfurling-<em>with</em> and -<em>within</em> a cosmic Story, I wonder how our perspectives and relations with others will shift.</p>

<p><em>It matters what stories tell stories,</em> espoused Donna Haraway.</p>

<p>To identify stories as one’s epistemology is to expand one’s modes for knowing the world. One comes to know the world then through stories, through netbags of metaphors in all its fuzzy logic. You invite imagination and poetry in the sensations of grass beneath your feet, in noticing the way the trees slow-waltz to certain rhythms of wind, in the line of ants marching up your walls. This allows for more ecological thinking, more thinking-with other critters, all of us entangled in an unfolding story, coming into full expression with one another.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The universe we live in gives birth to itself through relationships.
At the level of elementary particles, the neutron, by itself, disintegrates within 3 to 4 minutes. This is due to radioactive decay. On the other hand, if you bring the neutron in relationship with a proton, it will exist for a billion years. The very nature of the neutron relies upon forming a relationship with a proton for it to express itself.</p>

<p>Swimme talks about our true nature, so obvious but so overlooked, that we unfold-<em>with</em> others within this Story of the evolutionary cosmos. Through relationships with one another, we come into full expression of ourselves. Haraway echoes this, that <em>companion species are relentlessly becoming-with; Ontologically heterogenous partners become who and what they are in relational material-semiotic worlding. Natures, cultures, subjects, and objects do not preexist their intertwined worldings.</em></p>

<p><em>Sympoiesis</em>, or, collective-reproducing (Beth Dempster, 1998). In other words, relational worldings, collectively becoming-with others.</p>

<p>We invoke the spirit of collective autocatalytic<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> sets—collectively reproducing, collectively arising—to read matter, culture, consciousness. From the other side of the literature, Kauffman, theoretical biologist, origin of life researcher, extends the magic of stories, becoming-with, into the messy empiricism of science-meets-complexity,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…] the realisation that we are members of a living world of untellable creativity in its becoming. Life is abundant, the <strong><em>universe is rife with becoming</em></strong>, based on physics but beyond any physics we know. […] Creatures, by existing, <strong><em>create the very conditions for other creatures to come into existing</em></strong>. […] The blossoming biosphere creates its own ever-new possibilities of becoming, yet more diverse and abundant.</p>

  <p>This ultimate, an unknowable unfolding, slips its foundational moorings and floats free.</p>

  <p>We do not live alone, we make our living world together… We all are joined together in the evolving, emerging, unfolding of the biosphere as a whole.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hyphenated words opens up the semiotic space; how else can we articulate a language of collective-becoming, of sympoiesis? <em>If categories are unstable, we must watch them emerge within encounters</em>, Anna Tsing insists.</p>

<hr />
<p>Finally, a homage to the episode on Midnight Gospel that inspired this post, and lit up the synapses between the different authors I’m reading,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“So the Buddha looks at Indra’s Net and it’s basically the same topography, but he says, “it’s not the nodes. It’s the connections.”</p>

<p><sup> P.S. Recently, during meditation, my mind sometimes fall into some ad infinitum non-space (as vast as our consciousness can be), and I realised how art, or beauty, or the dewdrop of a moment (sensory alignment, before it plops and ends), is an interface into the larger consciousness. I wondered why in certain environments, I enter such states of mind more easily (e.g. when there is wind, sitting under open sky on my porch, humidity not too heavy, etc.) than other times, which led me to the (admittedly meek) insight that perhaps symmetry, experienced subjectively, acts as interface or gateway into something cosmic.</sup></p>

<p><sup>I realise also that wonder is important to me. to cultivate wonder is to cultivate joy &amp; love. Wondering why theory engages minimally with spirituality. </sup></p>
