I"<p>Information theory seems to permeate multiple podcasts I‚Äôve been listening to. It is also referred to in some media studies text I read; planning to understand this further, more intimately.</p>

<p>Pooling together insights/learnings from the following podcast episodes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mindscape: Sean Carroll with Robin Carhert-Harris</li>
  <li>Mindscape: Sean Carroll with Sara Imari Walker</li>
  <li>Making Sense: Sam Harris, Anaka Harris with Donald Hoffman</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="entropic-brain-principle"><strong>Entropic brain principle</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Taking psychedelics will put your consciousness into a more ‚Äòrelaxed state‚Äô</li>
  <li>Carhert-Harris calls it going into ‚Äúvery plastic brain states‚Äù, implying its artificiality relating to the norm-brain state</li>
  <li>The boundedness of imagination expands (more possibilities)</li>
  <li>We project things onto the metaphysical space</li>
  <li>In an <strong>information-theoretic view</strong>, this means higher entropy, more uncertainty and unpredictability</li>
  <li>Stream of consciousness</li>
  <li>Typically when one suffers from neuroses (e.g. depression, psychosis, anxiety, existential dread), it     reflects perhaps something akin to cognitive rigidity</li>
</ul>

<p>‚Äî What does this entropic state tells us about reflexivity, the ‚Äòego‚Äô self?</p>

<h3 id="access-to-archetypes-when-access-to-collective-unconscious-is-unlocked"><strong>Access to archetypes when access to collective unconscious is ‚Äúunlocked‚Äù</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Consistent psychedelic experiences across humans implies an archetypal reserve</li>
  <li>Archetypes reinforce the notion of metaphors and stories in perhaps uncovering the collective unconscious / tracing its origin / inception of our Universe</li>
</ul>

<p>What can the description of such archetypes tell us about its physics? Is a non-anthropocentric description possible? Or do archetypes necessarily peg onto (the observer‚Äôs) culture when activated - reminiscent of the anthropic principle from physics?</p>

<h3 id="hierarchical-organisation-in-the-higher-cortex-in-living-things-and-nature"><strong>Hierarchical organisation in the higher cortex, in living things and nature</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>The cortex has an hierarchical organisation</li>
  <li>The association cortex is at the top of this hierarchy
    <ul>
      <li>Mysterious and no modular, clear function</li>
      <li>Unlike the visual system</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Does something being fiction means it is less real than something? Who decides the ontological hierarchy? Layering ontologies being symptomatic of the hierarchical nature of the ordered universe?</p>

<h3 id="counterfactual-thinking-seems-to-be-unique-to-our-species"><strong>Counterfactual thinking seems to be unique to our species</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Ref. to the Bayesian brain theory</li>
  <li>Perhaps links nicely to the point that probabilities are, also, a useful fiction</li>
  <li>Includes imagination</li>
  <li>High-level functions</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="causality"><strong>Causality</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Causality can be an (epiphenomenon?) illusion, a useful fiction for the deeper theory of reality</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="information-theoretic-approach-for-consciousness"><strong>Information-theoretic approach for consciousness</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>High level processes like reasoning about things, having intentions, representation, seems irreducible to its (physical) neural substrates</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Relates to topics in the philosophy of mind; challenging the above view would be physicalism or any kinds of materialism</p>
  </li>
</ul>
