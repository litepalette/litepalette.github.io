<p><em>Practicing loose association, as I often feel in a hypnagogic state; though quite perilous if one is always in a state of wakelessness / sleepfulness. But practicing, also, hypertextuality, or making a statement about it, or something.</em></p>

<p><em>I penned this down while reading George Dysonâ€™s book Darwin among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence. When I write this, I also am thinking about Alien Phenomenology by Ian Bogost, Insect Media by Jussi Parikka, etc., etcâ€¦</em></p>

      <p>Computation via information processing and information communication/transmission is found across nature and artificial systems. Communication networks exist among eusocial organisms, like ant colonies.

      <p>Self-reproduction here refers to autocatalytic sets, which draws from Stuart Kauffmanâ€™s work on how life emerged from inorganic matter. Over here was when I started glancing through biology works, also thinking aboutÂ <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
