<p>&lt;Sociotechnical systems, on cybernetics, cyber-human physical systems, interdisciplinary study&gt;</p>

<p>â€œThe degree to which humans can control a cyber-social system depends on the nature of human-machine coalitions [â€¦But] our understanding of how blended coalitions of humans and AI function is just as unevolved and requires interdisciplinary studyâ€.</p>

<p>There is little to add to this inspired and inspiring viewpoint by @EnricoCoiera. Weâ€™ve recently focused on a specific type of cyber-social systems, those bound together by a sense of collaborative effort and common ground. We calledâ€™em cyborks, to recognize their liquid nature.</p>
