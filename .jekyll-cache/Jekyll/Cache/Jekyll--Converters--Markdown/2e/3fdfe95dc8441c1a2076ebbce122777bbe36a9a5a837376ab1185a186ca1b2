<h2 id="fieldnotes-difficulties-in-defining-human-and-machine-collaboration-hmc">fieldnotes: difficulties in defining human and machine collaboration (hmc)</h2>

<p>Defining human and machine collaboration has been challenging (albeit prescient &amp; useful).</p>

<p>I argue that this is because hmc is an age-old phenomenon that now requires a (drastic) shift in epistemologies to grasp it - from a substance paradigm to a process-based view. It forces us to question our ways of knowing. In a substance paradigm of knowing the world, we unwittingly base our metaphysics on static entities like substances, objects, atemporal events. Case in point: at work, we have now settled for the fact that hmc refers to ‚Äúa spectrum of technologies‚Äù, rather than the debates on what its component technologies are.</p>

<p>But implicit in this claim, is that human and machine collaboration is an <strong>emergent behavior</strong> of multiple layer(s) of components dynamically interacting. the human and machine ecology, then, is a complex system of humans and machines interacting.</p>

<p>And it is in such precarious times of pervasive and complex technologies where such collaborations become more <em>material</em>, and hence, more metaphysically suspect.</p>

  <p>The degree to which humans can control a cyber-social system depends on the nature of human-machine coalitions [‚Ä¶But] our understanding of how blended coalitions of humans and AI function is just as unevolved and requires interdisciplinary study‚Äù.</p>

  <p>There is little to add to this inspired and inspiring viewpoint by @EnricoCoiera. We‚Äôve recently focused on a specific type of cyber-social systems, those bound together by a sense of collaborative effort and common ground. We called‚Äôem cyborks, to recognize their liquid nature.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our results support the hypothesis that hominin reliance on stone tool-making generated selection for teaching and language, and imply that (i) low-fidelity social transmission, such as imitation/emulation, may have contributed to the B700,000 year stasis of the Oldowan technocomplex, and (ii) teaching or proto-language may have been pre-requisites for the appearance of Acheulean technology.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Self-organization:</em> Process metaphysics has traditionally been motivated by the fact that it seems to give the best explanation of the phenomena of emergence, originally understood as an integral feature of evolution. Since the development of scientific theories of ‚Äúself-organization,‚Äù ‚Äúchaos,‚Äù and ‚Äúcomplexity‚Äù have begun to alter our understanding of evolutionary change, there is a new need for a metaphysics that can accommodate all sorts of phenomena where dynamic organizations exert causal constraints. While older, speculative, process metaphysics embraced the idea of purposes and creativity in nature, and allowed for the explanatory category of a ‚Äòself-realizing‚Äô or ‚Äòself-engendering‚Äô entity (in various terminological guises), present-day analytical processists confine themselves to arguing that ‚Äúdownward causation‚Äù becomes perfectly intelligible once physicalism has been divorced from the assumptions of the substance paradigm, and most especially from the principle that causal powers cannot be attributed to dynamic organizations.</p>
