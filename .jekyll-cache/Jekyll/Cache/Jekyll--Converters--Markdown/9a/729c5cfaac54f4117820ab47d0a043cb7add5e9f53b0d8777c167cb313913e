<p>I think often about Taolin‚Äôs remarks in <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/547888/trip-by-tao-lin/"><em>Trip</em></a>, on how ‚Äúeverything is fractal‚Äù. This notion of fractality as that strange, ineffable phenomenon that underpins the logic of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrocosm_and_microcosm">microcosms</a> nicely ties with the concept of emergence; this refers to an entity or system having properties that its parts do not have on their own - we say we observe emergent properties when there is epistemic or ontological irreducibility to lower levels.</p>

<p>During my trip to Bali, I noticed similar patterns emerging across ‚Äúnatural‚Äù landscapes and anthropogenic marks. The aesthetical match is not-so uncanny, when we think about the self-similar characteristics of nature. I like to think we are genetic expressions of nature. And as Taolin puts it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>But humans, being natural, are also fractal and so enjoy behaving and creating fractally.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="\assets\img\bali-2.jpg" alt="bali-2" /></p>

<p>Thus, I had a loose conception, an idea:</p>

<p>terraformation is an emergent property of our earth‚Äôs biosphere.</p>

<p>The pattern continuity in the images reveal the self-similarities between human action and nature. Our actions and the imprints we leave are fractals emerging from the same universal pattern.</p>

<p>Hence we should not be surprised at the Anthropocene. Hence the distinction between nature and technics is problematic.</p>

<p>Time and again, concepts of emergence from astrobiology and physics strengthen the post-anthropocentric thought, where we hope to undergo a paradigm shift of knowing our world through <em>entanglements</em> of the same cosmic web.</p>

<h2 id="on-terraformation">on terraformation</h2>

<p><strong>Benjamin Bratton</strong> (Strelka Institute), architectural and design theorist, and <strong>Sara Imari Walker</strong> (ASU-SFI Center for Biosocial Complex Systems), theoretical physicist and astrobiologist, touched upon the concept ‚Äòterraformation‚Äô in different contexts. So I thought it worthwhile to poke at the convergences a little further, and understand where/why the disciplines might diverge.</p>

<hr />

<p>Bratton now helms the Strelka Institute, spearheading a research initiative titled <em>The Terraforming.</em></p>

<p>Terraforming, then, is defined as such:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The term ‚Äòterraforming‚Äô usually refers to transforming the ecosystems of other planets or moons to make them capable of supporting Earth-like life. However, the looming ecological consequences of human activities suggest that in the decades to come we might need to terraform our own planet if it is to remain a viable host for Earth-like life.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of his main assumption for this research program, in fact, interlocks with that from the field of astrobiophysics: <strong>the planet is artificially sentient</strong>.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, astrobiologist Sara Walker had an amazing <a href="https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2020/01/13/79-sara-imari-walker-on-information-and-the-origin-of-life/">podcast</a> with Sean Carroll, and refers to terraforming:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚Ä¶ in some sense the biosphere could reproduce itself, but in order to reproduce it would have to emerge a technological civilization that moved off-planet and terra-formed another planet to look exactly like our planet. And then you could think about planets as a whole, reproducing themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To Walker, our biosphere counts as a unit of life, where cross-planetary terraformation represents the reproducibility of our biosphere. Hence, any fully mature biosphere can generate sufficiently advanced beings to develop the ability to migrate beyond the biosphere and alter other planets to allow their own form of life to exist on the surface.</p>
