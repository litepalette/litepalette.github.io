<p>I sought to articulate convergent views on <strong><em>terra-formation</em></strong> from the two fields of urban design/philosophy and astrobiology/physics/origni of life.</p>

<p>along the way, to hopefully uncover a coherent line of research enquiry.</p>

<p>Benjamin Bratton has a new research project around this entire enterprise.</p>

<p>Tangentially, I was inspired when listening to Dr. Walkerâ€™s <a href="https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2020/01/13/79-sara-imari-walker-on-information-and-the-origin-of-life/">podcast</a> with Sean Carroll and was struck by the following remark she made:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€¦ in some sense the biosphere could reproduce itself, but in order to reproduce it would have to emerge a technological civilization that moved off-planet and terra-formed another planet to look exactly like our planet. And then you could think about planets as a whole, reproducing themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some lessons we can have from this:</p>

<p>The biosphere is a unit of life; and if you think about it, terraforming other planetary systems is a reproducible quality of earth.</p>
