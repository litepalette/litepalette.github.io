title: Rethinking the liquid natures of the human and machine ecology (draft)
---

*<sup>(i have written a little about it [here](https://litepalette.github.io/on-hmc) and am still actively trying to formulate my thoughts around it)</sup>*

with advances in philosophy, computer engineering and intelligent automation, we should be taking a renewed look at our digital milieu and our relationship within it. so embedded we are in it, that i believe it warrants a stronger recognition of the 21st century condition as what it always has been time perennial: multiple *ecologies* of humans and technologies.

we are unable to comprehend this worldview without the knee-jerk Ludditean reflex of estranging ourselves ontologically from the very tools we exist-with, understandably symptomatic of the culture-technics divide, i.e. *technology is separate from us, it is bad for us* â€“ i attribute this to the lag in updating our normative beliefs about being and perception. 

briefly indulging in counter-intuitions, what happens if we just embrace a process view of the world? 

the boundaries between the ontological status of humans and technology dissolves, as we pay more attention to the liquid natures of socio-technical systems; its flow being the fulcrum in which we orient our lives and perspective around.

a networked, process philosophy is nothing new. there are existing schools of philosophical thought that study this, such as the classic Latourian actor-network theory. to give this metaphysical statement more weight, i do feel we need an attempt at a transdisciplinary convergence of cybernetics, complexity science and cultural theory. 

slightly over a decade ago, cham & johnson (2007) pointed out the gaps between poststructuralism, complexity science and sociotechnical systems: 

> The science of cultural systems as part of complex systems theory is the postmodern science for the digital age.



a nod to the [reading](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-62051-0_7) that inspired this piece, it states:

> ... the need to move from a model-driven, component-oriented and intrinsically static view of systems to a more organic one, where the *complex entanglement between the social and the technical, as well as between the human and the artificial [...] leads to considering community morphogenesis...*
