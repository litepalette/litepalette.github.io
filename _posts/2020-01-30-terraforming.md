## On Terraforming

I sought to articulate convergent views on ***terra-formation*** from the two fields of urban design/philosophy and astrobiology/physics/origni of life. 

along the way, to hopefully uncover a coherent line of research enquiry. 

Benjamin Bratton has a new research project around this entire enterprise.



Tangentially, I was inspired when listening to Dr. Walker's [podcast](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2020/01/13/79-sara-imari-walker-on-information-and-the-origin-of-life/) with Sean Carroll and was struck by the following remark she made: 

> ... in some sense the biosphere could reproduce itself, but in order to reproduce it would have to emerge a technological civilization that moved off-planet and terra-formed another planet to look exactly like our planet. And then you could think about planets as a whole, reproducing themselves.



Some lessons we can have from this:

The biosphere is a unit of life; and if you think about it, terraforming other planetary systems is a reproducible quality of earth.
