title: Terraforming; Combining benjamin bratton & sara imari walker
---

I was inspired when listening to Dr. Walker's podcast with Sean Carroll and was struck by the following remark she made: 

> the biosphere is a unit of life; and if you think about it, terraforming other planetary systems is a reproducible quality of earth. 

of course, i sought to find convergences with benjamin bratton's terraforming design brochure, as he calls it.
