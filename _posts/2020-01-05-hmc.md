title: A world of human and machine collaboration is a world of processes

---

## What is human and machine collaboration (hmc)? 

it is an inevitably interdisciplinary science

### field notes at work 

stepping out, and into a critical ethnographic eye. 

there is difficulty in defining what HMC *means*. i attribute this to the habits of reading the world today, in absolutes and atemporal. 

i argue that when we shift into the unintuitive world of proccess, we see HMC in its rhizomatic form

## HMC should grasp onto cybernetics, HMC and ecology

in viewing HMC as a process, we need to engage with cybernetic thought. we measure the architectures of collaboration as an entire system. 

an ecology of differentiated actors - tying together fields from object-oriented ontology, post-anthropocene, post-design.
