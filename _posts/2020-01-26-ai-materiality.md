title: "Materiality of AI"
---


I intend to write about the discourse around "materiality" of AI - it unwittingly interlocking with the long history of <i>materialism</i>. 

Some obvious questions are: 
- How do we constitute harm - does harm only need to be material to be legitimate? 
- What about trauma in its abstraction, its rhizomatic form?
