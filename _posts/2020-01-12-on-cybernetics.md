"The degree to which humans can control a cyber-social system depends on the nature of human-machine coalitions [...But] our understanding of how blended coalitions of humans and AI function is just as unevolved and requires interdisciplinary study".

There is little to add to this inspired and inspiring viewpoint by @EnricoCoiera. We've recently focused on a specific type of cyber-social systems, those bound together by a sense of collaborative effort and common ground. We called'em cyborks, to recognize their liquid nature.

why is this not working :(
