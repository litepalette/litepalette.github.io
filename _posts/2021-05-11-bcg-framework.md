# Introduction
Elsewhere, I highlight the importance of sociotechnical relations in enabling technologies to succeed. 

This is reflected in how blockchain networks are *governed*. Broadly defined, governance refers to the process of managing the relations between different stakeholders towards shared objective(s).

This paper highlights that due to the decentralised nature of blockchains, governance in blockchain is different from governance in other forms of hierarchy, structures or organisations. In governance, decision-making is typically centralised within a locus of power, say, a government body or someone at the top of the organisation hierarchy. 

For enterprises who use blockchain technology (referred to as "enterprise blockchains") for various use case(s), governance can refer to deciding on terms of participation between stakeholders, data ownership, etcetera, in a way to help the companies on the blockchain achieve their goal. 

> Learning point #1: Governance in blockchain is different from other forms of organisation due to the former's decentralised nature.

For public blockchains, there is the adage "*In code we trust*". Social and business rules are encoded into code, which then automatically distributes power amongst the blockchain stakeholders. 

However, various events on public blockchains have undermined that philosophy.[[For example, the theft of Ether on 'the DAO', which led to a contentious governance issue where the core developers of Ethereum proceeded to do a hard fork to return the stolen Ether.::rmn]] If anything, decisions ultimately lie in people to make important decisions. 

Hence, governance in blockchain still remains vague as organisations or public blockchains struggle to optimise their blockchain networks. 

> Learning point #2: Challenges of blockchain governance today include a lack of understanding how governance might work, how key decisions are made and enforced. .
