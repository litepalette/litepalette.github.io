title: Blockchain, Socio-technical governance and Power
---



XX has reported that there is a trend towards blockchain consortium. 



Despite being touted as a part of the decentralised movement in a bid to undermine central authorities or intermediaries, we find that most of the time, for a successfull model, centralisation has to be key. 



In such cases of enterprise blockchain, power recuperates and manifests in the network architecture of enterprise blockchain.





## "The Blockchain Protocol Towards Post-Capitalism"



<u>Blockchain Utopianism</u> / An optimistic view 

* The logic of blockchain protocols can be used to rethink various architectures of power 
* We first have to be careful of fetishizing technologies as a necessary condition for the technological and material base underlying post-capitalist futures
* It should about deconstructing (hacking) the technological and semantic strata of the blockchain protocol in order to *make them 'tactical media'* exploiting loopholes of universal standardization to facilitate the emergence of a more free and democratic society
* If the technical is always political and network architecture is politics, the emergence of post capitalist futures resides not int he destruction of protocols, but in the capacity to hypertrophy, their potential to invent new modes of life - or, absent that, expose the dead ends in the current
  * techno-resistance is not outside protocol but at its center. tactical media propel protocol into a state of hypertrophy, pushing it further, in better and more interesting ways. 





<u>Protocols Perpetuate Networks of Control</u>

* Decentralised electronic systems do not oppose Deleuze's societies of control (Galloway)
* Disciplinary governments have been replaced by technical protocols with elusive localisation and distributed management
* E.g. Private blockchain networks
  * Public and permissioned blockchain
  * Private and permissionless blockchain 

We have to unpack the dimensions in this and clarify any conflation that might not serve our purpose. 

For example, the idea of a 'publics' and therefore 'read' access to data 





## Deterritorialisation and blockchain

Drawing upon Deleuze's 



the architecture and abstraction demanded of understanding blockchain invokes a tangential thought. it is so similar to the deterretorialisation of Deleuze & Guattari.
