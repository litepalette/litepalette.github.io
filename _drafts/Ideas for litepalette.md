much inspiration ; but all stems from a good knowledge of html and css. i can do this

# short-term
- [x] under **notes**, arrange in chronological date order

- [x] change icons for main menu

- [ ] add a "last edited" portion under each post. put last edited post at the top. 

- [ ] Adding audio player mp3 to every post so the reader knows my aural space when i am writing the posts. 

- [ ] randomising snapshots
	- https://jekyllcodex.org/without-plugin/randomize/
	- show only one post, maybe


- [ ] moodboard link pinned ðŸ“Œ to the header. 
	- 07.05 made progress by removing pagination! :) now to add:
		- description for moodpage - linked to snapshot randomizer
		- zhngup the div for each post perhaps
		- add into profile or as part of the nav bar. yippee

## css
- [x] Add blockquote design

# medium-term
- short text areas; no need click through to read the whole post. to encourage more outbursts and random things. 
	- e.g. evy.garden

- mood portals
	- how would this look like?

- snapshots of trees and a caption/alt text - since i capture so many pictures of trees. 
	- a button to generate green pic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! omgosh so excited. 

- adding audio to places
