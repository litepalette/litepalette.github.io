# short-term
- [ ] under **notes**, arrange in chronological date order

# medium-term
- short text areas; no need click through to read the whole post. to encourage more outbursts and random things. 
	- e.g. evy.garden

- mood portals
	- how would this look like?

- snapshots of trees and a caption/alt text - since i capture so many pictures of trees. 
	- a button to generate green pic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! omgosh so excited.
