**Anthropocene: The Human Epoch (2018)**



So I watched this film last year, and it made an impact on me somewhat, but I can't seem to find the link to it anymore. Here are some scribbles I had on the film from that time, and maybe you should too.

Directed by Edward Burtynsky, whose photography works have triggered the

Environment, art documentary

Meditation on the whole scale of human impact 

Environments that resonated that. 

Time of sustained reflection. Back to temporal reality, maybe there's been some kind of journey or transformation

Ambition of the project to look at the whole human project in geological time, planetary scale, through magic of cinema 

An aesthetic project 

A poetic reflection for earth 

*which illuminates how unnatural and strange human activity and industry are in all of their permutations*



A lot of times the forms on the screen is incomprehensible to the viewer after realises they’re patterns scarred upon earth from human impact. 

**The use of aesthetics to deliver the film’s message for action. A sustained meditation, a step before action.** 

Its political ontology – or call to action, if you will – is embedded in the aesthetics of monumentalism. Beauty 

To achieve the effect it aims to, in evoking ‘sustained meditation and reflection’, the cinematic marvel of the film was a deliberate aestheticization of the human scarring of the earth. Undulating abstract patterns and forms. Art pieces (which?). The shots of grandeur, defamiliarization and abstraction of our planet’s lands was meant to evoke a mysterious, spooky uncertainty. In its incomprehensibility, its unreadability, the images push us into the realm of the sublime, and there, we experience a vertigo. It’s a moment where something decentres us, upon the gradual realisation that we are existentially limited, relative to the bogus uncertainty that lies outside of possible conscious grasp, an ontological shift. 

The last shot was powerful; Contrasting abstract patterns with human indulgence. That seamless transition from rocks to human [splat], humans lounging on the beach. In that moment I felt repulsed at the insouciance, our ignorance. In that moment I was defamiliarized and was observing humans as an Other. A species independent of myself, what creatures in odd forms.

Not realising that we are within deep time, living, consuming, breathing next to our geological clocks. 

The large excavator. The oil mines. At every junction the film keeps the viewer in excitable anticipation for the next scene, *what’s next?* A voyeurism.  

Poetic anthology and vignettes of anthropocenic earth. A spectacle, a mosaic, quilt. Multifaceted.
