**meditation**

what is it like to have your breath
sucked out of your body

When breathing strikes to a singularity, where
It's tight and â€”
*Zero*

When I was younger, I told my father about my anxiety about anxieties. He told me he clears his head best in the shower. When thoughts are running, he likes to visualize the number 0 in the shower. That night, I traced the number zero on the shower door. 

Now, I wonder if he thinks of the number 0
When he gazes out at the sunlit greenery
A light he could never again bask in
I imagine time feels warped and stretched
When you're bound to a single point in space
Granted only with micromovements

The number zero.
My father tethers around infinity and nothingness.

Presently, the ambience here fills with his lack of breath
Echoes of heavy coughs and choked voices now seep into my half-conscious haze,
Where he always sits upright in my dreams, 
talks to me about electric sheep and holds my hands through carnivals.

Background. My father has went through multiple strokes and he's bound to his bed in the living room. Every two days, my helper and mom would have to use a machinery to suck the saliva/phlegm out of his throat so that it doesn't collect in his lungs. He has been sent to the hospital a few times due to pneumonia arising from that. I hear it's painful. We have the oximeter on his thumb everytime this is done to make sure his heart rate doesn't go > 130, or oxygen <90. This piece is me thinking through the ambience of having to care for a sick person at home; machine making weird coagulating mess of sounds and having his breath sucked
