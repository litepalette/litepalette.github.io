title: A Study on Flow in The Age of Covid-19: Zoonotic String Figures, Timescales
---

<sup>*I decided to write on this topic as I was intrigued with the significance of flow in our current moment, but struggled articulate it. In the process of writing, did I then find the points I was trying to make: the simple act of noticing flow, shifting to a relational paradigm of looking, where transmissions of power, infectious agents, affects, ebb and swell, the medium, and the sediments circulate, can we hope to muster a more differentiated and kinder response-ability to help other humans and critters alike. It matters what ideas we use to think other ideas with.* </sup>

The current pandemic draws our attention to the ontology of flow and interconnectedness. It is continua all the way down, up, beyond and back around; the transmission of the virus, messages, affects, behaviors, circulates in strange feedback loops. 

Jussi Parikka and Tony Simpson [note](https://www.boundary2.org/2020/04/tony-d-sampson-and-jussi-parikka-the-new-logics-of-viral-media/) the workings of a viral logics that criss-crosses from biological to cultural, technological and economic contexts. Contagion of all kinds leak out of bodies, social media, reactive emergency policies — its emergence swells across micro and macro scales. Social contagion make this a distinctly information-age pandemic, as psychological fear, anxiety, mistrust or performances of resilience ride on the circulation of behaviors and affects across online media and public health communications. Furthermore, as the virus dominates glo-cal discourses, the dangers of converging to a [memetic monoculture](https://complexity.simplecast.com/episodes/27/transcript) looms. One question, then, is whose narrative will preside over?

Author Sophie Lewis talked of our "[wateriness](https://thenewinquiry.com/amniotechnics/)". In this context, precarity lies in porousness that allows for contagious flows. Risk of contagion abounds not only in contiguous bodies and breath, but also within containers that societies use to conceptualise others. For some, those in crowded worker dormitories, the workplace with no sick leave, essential services workers, porousness cannot be escaped. And yet, porousness is only revealed insomuch as power allows for its visibility, and in extension, the shaping of its associated risk and policies to mitigate them. What does it take for us to trace the ebbs and swells of flows, and leave no container unturned? How can we necessitate differential response-abilities among State bodies, grassroots efforts and individuals to extend flows to those ?

COVID-19 being a zoonotic disease also makes a strong case for humans' interconnectedness to a multispecies world. [Zoonoses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis) are infectious diseases that jump from non-human animals to humans, its vice versa being called reverse zoonosis. The virus infecting over 1 million humans (and [nonhumans](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/animals.html)) worldwide ignites the *string figures* entangling humans and nonhuman critters alike. String figures, commonly known as the object of “cat’s cradle”, is a game where a string is weaved around the fingers from different people, constantly overlaps and intersects with itself. Donna Haraway co-opted this term to conjure a symbol of our relations in a multispecies world, highlighting the neccessity to produce new connections and alliances for a multispecies flourishing. 

Indeed, the virus travels along the path of string figures, from bat to human, human to human. Affects follow similar routes, flowing along the distributaries of media multiplexity. 

To the virus, all species are reduced as hosts for its survival. 

We know that COVID-19 is notorious for its density-dependent transmission — but what of its temporal elements? 

I take cues from Haraway's book *Staying with the Trouble*, which tells of a world, our world, being a polytemporal one. With this, I turn to the field of complexity science, to a podcast episode I came across: 

According to epidemologists, every pathogen has its own epidemic cycle. 

On timescales, I quote David Krakeur in a recent podcast: 

> SFI has been for a long time fascinated with this topic of “complex time,” which is how temporal phenomena play out across the scales of the complexity of the earth. And what evolution has done is it's created this interesting coupling of all of these clocks. You can think of every species as being a little clock that ticks away at its own rate and we interact at some level, but we're not strongly coupled. And if we strongly couple, then you get these strange synchronizations that appear. And in this case, the synchronization is dominated by the fastest clock. And in the case of transmission, that could be a lethal synchronization.

Complexity science shows us how there is potential for strange synchronisations to arise across multiple species. Andy Dobson's paper showed that an epidemic in a smaller organism can drive disease dynamics in a larger organism. In a hypercapitalist world of exploitation and extraction of nature, increasing couplings across species provided the perfect conditions for COVID-19 to emerge. And this is where the temporalities start to blur: 

As if spacetime could not get more m

More importantly, bodily ethical and political obligations are also infectious. In a time of flow,

It is during these times where we look to one another as companion species

Advocating for cybernetics. 

The cybernetics of a world only recently aware of its hyper-contagious nature is now cognisant of its pre-existing multi-spatial/temporalities. How can we rethink flow as the state of being, adopt an ethics with what Donna Haraway speaks of as living-with and dying-with other beings? How has the pandemic edged us into relooking contiguity as it relates to physical and virtual proximity? 



//end of with something about ontology of flow again.
