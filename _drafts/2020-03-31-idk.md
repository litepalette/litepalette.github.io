things or projects i can do now that will make me feel happy, fulfilled, and feels relevant now: 



- commiting to codinggirls smallbytes series 
- writing <u>notes. on - x</u> for topics i'm interested in 
- collecting mutual aid sharing docs in one place - my excel -- maybe sharing this with others too 
- creative coding lessons 
  - seems like i can only do this if (1) i have no plans to read/write, (2) no codinggirls work
  - both of which seem to be taking up most of my time now.. :0

- reading insights on the pandemic -- how the things i am studying can play a part, e.g. complexity, new materialism

to find a starting point, and commit for 

- **new materialism**
- **complexity science**
- **philosophy of information**
