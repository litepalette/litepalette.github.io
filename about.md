currently and independently researching topics around technology, software studies in singapore. 

this blog makes up a palette of looseleaf writing snippets - little blocks of writings on topics i find illumining. sometimes ordered, mostly not. weaving together convergences across humanities, critical theory and computer science.

click [home](/) to read my writings, & view the more messier notes [here](http://litepalette.github.io/notes) ðŸ¦‹

tangentially, i'm also interested in and engage with topics in: consciousness, AI/machine ethics, ecosophy.

most of the text here is autodidactic. words might be clumsy. so form a study/reading group with me(!), or talk to me about anything at vanessaauraphin@gmail.com.
