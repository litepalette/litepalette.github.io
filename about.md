*click [home](/) to read my writings, & view messier notes [here](http://litepalette.github.io/notes). the [tags](/tags) page is a good place to gage the topics i think and write about ðŸ¦‹*

currently and independently researching topics that orbit around complexity, natureculture, socio-technical systems.  
this blog makes up a palette of looseleaf writings - little blocks of writings on topics i find illumining. sometimes ordered, mostly not. weaving together convergences across humanities, critical theory and computer science.

most of the text here is autodidactic. write to me at vanessaauraphin@gmail.com. 

this site was made using Raghuveer's theme [Simply Jekyll](https://simply-jekyll.netlify.app/).
