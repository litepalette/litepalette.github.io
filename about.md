perpetually tending to this digital garden.

currently and independently researching topics that orbit around complexity, natureculture, socio-technical systems, which you may sometimes find on the [main page](/).

you can also read my moods and stuff and heartful [notes](http://litepalette.github.io/notes).

this blog makes up a palette of looseleaf writings - little blocks of writings on topics i find illumining. sometimes ordered, mostly not. weaving together convergences across humanities, critical theory and computer science.
