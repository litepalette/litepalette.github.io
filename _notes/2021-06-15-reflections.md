title: identifying the intrinsic from extrinsic motivations
excerpt: <!--blank-->

exercises I practice to clear the noise:
- Make a list of "what is important to me" and continuously update it
- In another column, make a list of "what I do not care about/for"
- Meditate, Deep Breaths, Moments of "Dropping Everything"
