As landscapes are embedded in languages (perhaps more distinct in indigenous cultures),  they are utilised for directionality, rooted in morality. [[see David Abram's *Spell of the Sensuous (1997)* or Keith Basso's  *Wisdom sits in places (1996)* ::rsn]]

What about cyberscapes embedded in language?

We see semblances of this in computer terminologies; fog computing, cloud computing; rhetorical devices to conceal its materiality.

Do we argue that it's an empty signifier? Or does this signify a world and time to come, where our referrent exist no longer, becoming myths? 

Can we create new languages that encode cyberspaces in less abstracted ways?
