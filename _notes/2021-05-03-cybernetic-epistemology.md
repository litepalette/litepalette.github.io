title: What is "cybernetic epistemology"?
excerpt: <!--blank-->
---

Came across the term from the book [[Possible Minds (2019)]].

- embodied responses with external perceptors
	- e.g. somatic things with my phone
	- feeling pain or disgust 
- these embodied responses are phenomenological links with the world external to your subjective perception
