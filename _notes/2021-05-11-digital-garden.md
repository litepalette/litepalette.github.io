This is intended to reflect on my practice of digital gardening.

Since I spend hours and days doing this, I thought to have a sort of self-reflexive exercise to have some clarity on my intentions. 

# History
During the circuit breaker period (Singapore's version of a COVID-19 lockdown), I started discovering the communities for tools for thought, on Twitter and on Are.na. 

Being an information hoarder who mostly used OneNote, I thought this was really nice


# Tools I use

Here is my "digital garden stack": 

- Obsidian
- Pocket
- Github Pages/Jekyll
- Twitter Bookmarks
- Notion (mainly for its Web Clipper)


Previously, I toyed with Roam Research and Notion, but they weren't too ideal for storing and writing notes.
