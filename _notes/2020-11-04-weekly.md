it's been a few months since i posted. i have since changed to a new theme, though am still in the midst of customising it. when my laptop is in the repair shop, i could mostly look forward to customising and changing up my theme.

this new theme has multiple interesting features, and i love how it segregates "notes" from my actual post, as that was my original intention. 

this is me stating here that i wish to be more lucid in thinking, and incisive. 

anyway i'm going to delete this post; was a test one :) 

exciting notes coming up, on: 

- cosmic waters
- ephemera
- symbolic AI
- singaporean and southeast asian cosmotechnics
- the changing of dust

am trying to make this as painless as possible, and enjoyable
