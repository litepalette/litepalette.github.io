> Music as a portal with consonant frequencies to access substratum consciousness 

When meditating, and playing music, somehow it puts me at a kind of mood. Although this brings up the question of *am I really reverting to a truer nature of mind* if I am feeling something akin to pleasure listening to certain chord progressions. 

Though I'm sure there's something deeper that's worth being said here.
