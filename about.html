    <div class="about__content">
        
        currently building up a practice across theory and digital objects. in my day job, i think about thought leadership and policy directions for human and machine collaboration systems in Singapore and blockchain consortia governance. with a media studies and social science background, i seek to unearth interplays between these fields and cohere some research inquiries.        
        
        <br><br> other times, i'm in charge of marketing & partnerships at <a href="http://codinggirls.sg"> CodingGirls SG</a>.

        <br><br>tangentially, i'm also interested in and engage with topics in: consciousness & intelligence, AI/machine ethics, theoretical physics, ecocriticism, creative coding & computational creativity.

		<br><br>most of the text here is autodidactic. words might be clumsy. so form a study/reading group with me(!), or talk to me about anything at vanessaauraphin@gmail.com.
